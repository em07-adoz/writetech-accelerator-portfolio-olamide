## What I Improved

- Added clear **installation and setup instructions** with examples to reduce friction for first-time users.  
- Enhanced **API endpoint documentation** to demonstrate real-world use cases (e.g., managing contacts, creating campaigns).  
- Streamlined **navigation and structure** for better discoverability of key features and references. 

## Challenges
- Striking the right balance between **technical depth** and **beginner readability**.  
- Ensuring **consistency across multiple contributorsâ€™ writing styles**.  
- Maintaining accuracy while simplifying explanations.  

## What I Learnt
- How to write **developer-focused documentation** that is both concise and comprehensive.  
- Best practices for **structuring open-source documentation** in a scalable way.  
- The importance of **clarity, consistency, and examples** in helping users adopt a platform quickly.
