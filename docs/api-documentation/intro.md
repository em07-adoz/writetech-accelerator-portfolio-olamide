# API Documentation Project

This project documents the **Chimoney public REST API**, including a **Getting Started** guide and selected endpoints for payouts, account balance, and redeeming vouchers.

## Live Site
[Chimoney API](https://chimoney.readme.io/reference/introduction)

## What I Improved
- Structured the documentation into clear sections (Getting Started, Authentication, Endpoints, Error Handling).
- Added sample cURL and Postman requests for developers to test quickly.
- Reformatted the content into Markdown for easy readability and GitHub Pages compatibility.

## Challenges
- Understanding and testing the different payout types (airtime, gift card, bank transfer).
- Ensuring authentication details (API keys, headers) were implemented correctly in requests.

## What I Learnt
- How to set up and structure developer-friendly API documentation.
- The importance of clear examples (cURL/Postman) in reducing the learning curve for new users.
