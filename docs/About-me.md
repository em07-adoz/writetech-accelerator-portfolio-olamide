I am a technical writer with a background in Electronic and Electrical Engineering, passionate about technology, design, and clear communication. I specialize in simplifying complex technical concepts into clear, engaging, and user-friendly content, with a focus on software, hardware, and user experience. My goal is to create impactful resources that empower learners, support innovation, and make technology more accessible.
